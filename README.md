## Homebrew

Firstly, we need Homebrew to manage dependencies. 

In the dotfiles we have a Brewfile. We need to install brew, install git, clone the dotfiles repo, then run the brewfile.

- Install homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
- `brew install git`
- `git clone https://github.com/iHiD/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
